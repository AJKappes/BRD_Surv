#### Genetic Marker Selection Implications for Bovine Respiratory Disease SEIR Modeling in a Bayesian Environment

The epidemiological Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) model has been widely used to study simulated disease outbreaks. This study evaluates how genetic marker selection impacts bovine respiratory disease (BRD) spread in a representative U.S. feedlot. We extend the SEIR model by allowing cattle to move directly from exposed to recovered without becoming infectious. This movement takes place in a Bayesian environment based on a BRD resistance rate influenced by calf production using genetic marker selection technology at the cow-calf operation level.
